## Biomedical Image Analysis
`Numpy` `SciPy` `Matplotlib`

In this repo, I have tried to cover the fundamentals of image analysis using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. All the contents are adopted from the datacamp course - Biomedical Image Analysis in Python (mainly from the exercises and its solution of mine).Here I have navigated through whole-body CT scan, segmented a cardiac MRI time series, and determined whether Alzheimerâ€™s disease changes brain structure.
